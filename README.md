#servant-auth-cookie

##Description

Authentication via encrypted client-side cookies, inspired by
[client-session](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/clientsession)
library by Michael Snoyman and based on ideas of the paper
["A Secure Cookie Protocol"](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~alexliu/publications/Cookie/cookie.pdf)
by Alex Liu et al.


##Warning
This library is under development.

At the moment here is already working example of cookie
authentication, but further research and testing should be done.
Some underlying mechanisms will be changed as well as the module API.
